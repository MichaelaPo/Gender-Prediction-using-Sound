[Gender-Prediction-using-Sound-DataCamp-project](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/97)

The same name can be spelled out in a many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Sound can, therefore, be a better way to match names than spelling. In this project, I used the Python package Fuzzy to find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.

To complete this project, I used pandas DataFrames, NumPy for basic statistics, and Matplotlib for plotting.
